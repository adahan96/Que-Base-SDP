Karl Wernicke, in the 1870s, formulated a model of the brain mechanisms for language
processes. What are the two major brain areas involved (name them or give the major function),
and how are these two connected?  
!!!
The molecules kinesin and dynein are involved in what important neuronal activity? (2 points)
!!!
How is the hindbrain involved in some of the highest levels of human behavior (complex or
unique behavior)? Answer by giving just one example.
!!!
Describe an example of diaschisis. Be as specific as you can. What major factor affects how
long it lasts? 
!!!
What was Karl Lashley's principle of equipotentiality? What led Lashley to this
(incorrect) conclusion? Your answer should refer to his experiments. 
!!!
Name two persons in the history of neuroscience before 1900 who argued for
“localization of function” and briefly describe the nature of their evidence. 
!!!
The two ions that are most involved in the action potential are __________________
and _______________________. They pass through the axonal membrane via
______________-gated ion channels. These channels are actually
__________________ embedded in the cell membrane. 
!!!
What are two behavioral specializations, in primates, that include expanded control
areas in the CNS.
!!!
The worm-like animal Amphioxus has a nervous system that is “simpler” than that of
many insects. Yet, it is a member of our phylum, the chordates. Why is it classified as
a chordate? 
!!!
Describe one of the long pathways connecting the neocortex with the spinal cord.
State the direction of information flow, and specify the location of the cell bodies and
the synaptic connections. 
!!!
Describe either the sympathetic or the parasympathetic innervation of the heart. 
!!!
The protein called Sonic Hedgehog plays an important role in the induction of the
nervous system from the primitive ectoderm. In our phylum, this molecule comes
from the _________________________ (a structure in the embryo). Later it is also
secreted by the _____________ ___________________ of the neural tube. 
!!!
What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric cell division during the
stage of proliferation in the neural tube?
!!!
In the early development of the neocortex, proliferating cells migrate from the
ventricular or subventricular layer to the cortical plate by what mechanism? 
!!!
Name two mechanisms that can determine temporal patterns of neuronal activity,
other than reflexes. 
!!!
What are the two lesions of the cat brain used in a demonstration of the Sprague
effect (which demonstrated corticotectal diaschisis). 
!!!
Name a retinal neuron that does not fire action potentials. Name another one that
does fire action potentials. 
!!!
Humans and monkeys with ablation of the striate cortex (primary visual cortex) are
blind in some tests and not in others. Give an example of each type of test, one in
which they fail and another where they show visual ability. 
!!!
Why do the cochlear nuclei have specific neurons that fire an action potential for
every arriving action potential in its 8th nerve input? Answer by describing the
function of precise timing at this early stage in the auditory pathway. 
!!!
What is the major kind of problem that animals have after ablations of the auditory
neocortical areas? Name or describe two auditory abilities that are not disturbed by
such lesions. 
!!!
Name or describe two of the three deficits that make up the Brown-Sequárd
syndrome. What is the lesion causing this syndrome? 
!!!
Lesions of the raphé nuclei of the midbrain and hindbrain cause ___________________
in animals. The severity of this problem is proportional to the amount of destruction of
the serotonin-containing raphé neurons. 
!!!
Electrophysiological studies in the _____________________ (species)
found evidence for coincidence detectors in nucleus laminaris, which corresponds to
the medial superior olive in the mammal. The coincidence detection results in a map
of ______________________________. 
!!!
 Neurons in auditory neocortical areas respond best to what aspect of
sound stimuli? ______________________________.
